# Nigelrex's Functions

Nigelrex's function provide a set of awesome stuff to program with ease.

```js
import "@nigelrex/functions";
// your code
const result = input("Enter your phone number: ", 20000);
console.log(result);
```

This is a simple 2 line code to get input from CLI from a user just like in python.

```js
import "@nigelrex/functions";
sleep(5000);
// OR
wait(5000);
```

Lazy to type `console.log()` and wished `log()` just worked fine

```js
import "@nigelrex/functions";
log("Hello World!");
```

That works now!!

This acts like a setTimeout and waits untill the provided time in ms

Needed to import moment for a unix timestamp?

```js
import "@nigelrex/functions";
log(new Date().unix());
```

This is much better right?
